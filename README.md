ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jelena. After several years in the field of administration, I discovered a strong passion for the world of programming.

Throughout self learning and online courses, I gained experience in programming in Python, working with files, 
databases, web data, basic GUI development (Tkinter), and simulating Raspberry Pi and SenseHAT capabilities. I actively
implemented object-oriented programming concepts in Python and acquired a basic understanding of SQL. Following the 
completion of the current project, my intention is to focus on OOP and start working on projects involving SQL, as I am 
particularly interested in this aspect of programming. I am proficient in using tools such as VS Code and GitHub.

In my leisure time, I enjoy activities such as cycling, outdoor pursuits, reading science fiction and fantasy books, and playing board games.
