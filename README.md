ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jelena. After several years of working in the field of administration, I discovered a strong passion for the world of programming.

Throughout self learning and online courses, I gained experience in programming in Python, SQLite, HTML, CSS and JS. I am 
particularly interested in backend development. 

In my leisure time, I enjoy activities such as cycling, outdoor pursuits, reading science fiction and fantasy books, and playing board games.
